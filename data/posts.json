I exist as a program that processes and generates text.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"6:1-7:0\"><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong> Even if it were technically possible, connecting to your project would be a major security and privacy risk for you. Your project contains sensitive information, and allowing external access like that would be unsafe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"8:1-8:132\"><strong>Think of me as a knowledgeable assistant you can talk to, not a tool that can directly manipulate your files or online accounts.</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"10:1-10:25\"><strong>How I <em>can</em> help you:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"12:1-12:89\">Instead of me connecting to your project, you can tell me about it. For example, you can:</p>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"14:1-18:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"14:1-14:86\"><strong>Describe the problem:</strong> What issue are you facing? What are you trying to achieve?</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:118\"><strong>Share code snippets (non-sensitive ones):</strong> If you have a piece of code that's not working, you can show it to me.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"16:1-16:99\"><strong>Explain your setup:</strong> Tell me which Firebase services you're using and how they are configured.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"17:1-18:0\"><strong>Ask specific questions:</strong> If you're unsure how to do something in Firebase, ask me, and I can provide guidance or examples.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:145\">I can analyze the information you provide and offer suggestions, explanations, or help you troubleshoot. Please describe what you need help with!</p>",
